## The Challenge
> - This is where you communicate the contribution of your work 
> - What do you want to learn?
> - How are you going to learn it?
> - What do you think will happen?
> - Sometimes you might have objectives instead of hypotheses. But usually you want to write your objectives as though they are hypotheses because they probably are. Sometimes you have hypotheses and objectives. That's ok, all these rules can be broken.

## What do you want to learn
- To learn x, we did y
- Bad challenges focus on information rather than knowledge
- Bad challenges focus on results rather than the meaning of results

## What do you want to learn (examples)
> - how facial expressions moderate prejudice
> - how favorable participants felt toward people displaying angry, neutral, and happy facial expressions.
> - how men and women are represented in the cognitive schemas of social categories around the world (to learn x)
> - how strongly prejudice against the men and women of social categories were related to prejudice against those categories overall (we did y)

## The Opening
> - Identity the problem that drives the research (What you want to learn)
> - Introduce the key characters (the key variables)
> - Target an audience (general vs. specialist)

## Bad Openings
> - Misdirect the reader by introducing non-essential characters
> - Have no direction. They explain concepts that the audience alrady understands

## Targeting an audience -- Elevator Pitches
> - Give your one-sentence summary of what you want to learn
> - Pause
> - If the person wants to learn more, they'll ask a question. 
> - Tell them how you plan to learn it, and your predictions

## Think-Pair-Share
- 1st years team up with second years. Every group should have one 1st year
- Introduce yourselves!
- Refine your elevator pitches! Develop a one-sentence elevator pitch aimed at each level
- You have 5 minutes

## Targeting an audience -- Paper Structure
- Thesis Committee: very knowledgable audience
- Journal: specialist audience
- Grant: general audience
- consequences for what counts as jargon
- Two paper structures:
    - OCAR for journals and theses
    - ABDCE for grants

## OCAR
- Opening: Grab audience attention (but which audience?)
    - Start very wide for a general audience
    - Start more narrowly for a specialist audience
- Challenge: state your contribution (end of introduction)
- Action: methods and results
- Resolution: discussion

## ABDCE
- Action: opening and challenge combined at start of paper
- Background: literature review
- Development: proposed methods
- Climax: predictions
- End: conclusion/resolution

## Opening/Challenge of Grant
- Use a 2-step opening
    - Open with larger issue that engages audience
    - Quickly switch to your issue
    - 2 steps is good. 3 is bad. This must happen quickly.
- What do you want to learn?
- How will you learn it?
- What do you think will happen?

## Word Race!
> - You must write at least 300 words
> - You have 10 minutes
> - You will write the Opening/Challenge of a grant for your research topic
> - Go!

## Think-Pair-Share
- Team up again!
- Every group must have one 1st year
- Everyone will read someone else's work.
- Tell them what you are thinking as you read it
    - Opening too general? Too specific?
    - What are the 2 steps?
    - Can you make sentences punchier? (shorter; powerful words in the stress positions)
    - Tell them what you think the contribution is
    - Would you keep reading?
- You have 5 minutes

## Next week
- Setting a schedule
- Starting finding articles for your proposal 
- [sci-hub](sci-hub.tw)
- Check Canvas for updates and assignments
